## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A simple local server (recommended for API access)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elkbany/Storeify.git
   cd Storeify
   ```

2. **Serve the Project**

   Option A: Open `index.html` directly in your browser (basic testing)

   Option B: Use a local server for full functionality

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using npx
   npx http-server .

   # Option 2: Using Live Server extension (VS Code)
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or provided URL)

---

## üõôÔ∏è Usage Guide

1. Visit the homepage to view all products.
2. Click a product card to view its details.
3. Click **Add to Cart** to add the item.
4. Access the **mini-cart sidebar** to view and remove items.
5. All data resets on refresh (no backend storage).

---

## üßê How It Works

- JavaScript fetches product data from `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`.
- Products are rendered dynamically into HTML cards.
- When you click "Add to Cart", it updates an in-memory cart object.
- The cart UI is updated immediately using DOM manipulation.
- There's no backend; it's a purely front-end simulation.
